# Password Generator

## Description

Generates a safe and secure password based off a set of criteria requested by the user. Each required criterion is pompted to the user on the browser window. The user inputs are checked for their validity and display error messages if the inputs are invalid. The user inputs are used to filter the generated password to follow the requirements that were selected. 

During the project, Abdelrahman learnt how to use arrow function shorthand, spread syntax (...) to expand an iterable object, forEach loop shorthand, and pointing to functions to be repeatedly invoked and provide different results. Abdelrahman also gained the valuable skill of making functions to prevent writing repeated code, as well as understanding how to structure data to apply specific properties that alter the data as required.
